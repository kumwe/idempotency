/**
 * Contract for the durable ledger that lets a replay-protected mutation run at most once per key.
 *
 * Application owns this contract for the same reason it owns `TransactionManager`: which operations are
 * replay-protected, and what a reservation means, are use-case decisions, while the store that keeps
 * them is a driver detail. `PersistentIdempotencyMiddleware` walks this port through a whole reservation
 * lifecycle — reserve, read back after a collision, take a dead record over, complete, release — and
 * `DoctrineIdempotencyLedger` is the shipped adapter. Nothing here names a connection, a platform or a
 * query builder, so the delivery layer that consumes it never sees the database it writes.
 *
 * A record is keyed by subject, operation and idempotency key, and the implementation must arbitrate
 * concurrent first attempts on that identity itself — `reserve()` is expected to be decided by a unique
 * constraint rather than by a read that another request could interleave with. Every conditional write
 * answers with a truthful boolean: true only when this caller's claim landed on exactly one record.
 *
 * @since  2.0.0
