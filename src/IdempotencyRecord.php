/**
 * One entry in the idempotency ledger: the request that claimed a key, and the answer it may replay.
 *
 * This is where the replay rules live, so no caller has to re-derive them. The request itself is never
 * kept — only the SHA-256 of its canonical encoding — so a repeat can be proved identical without the
 * ledger retaining a payload, and a repeat that differs is rejected rather than quietly served the
 * first request's answer. Every rule that could make a stored answer wrong is enforced in one place:
 * the constructor refuses a record whose result and state disagree, and each transition returns a new
 * instance rather than mutating the one already handed out.
 *
 * The private constructor makes `begin()` the only way in and `complete()` or `fail()` the only ways
 * out of `IN_PROGRESS`, so the lifecycle cannot be entered halfway or run backwards. Subject and
 * operation travel with the key because a key means nothing on its own — a store scopes it to one
 * caller and one operation before looking it up.
