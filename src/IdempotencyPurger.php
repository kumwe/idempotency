/**
 * Contract for reclaiming idempotency records whose retention window has closed.

 * An idempotency store grows with every replay-protected request, so something has to reclaim the
 * records nobody can replay any more. An implementation deletes in bounded batches and must leave
 * any record a request still owns — an unexpired lock, or an owner token not yet released — in
 * place, so a purge running beside live traffic never strips the protection from an operation still
 * in flight. The scheduled `PurgeIdempotencyRecordsHandler` drives the loop, and stops as soon as a
 * call returns a short batch.
