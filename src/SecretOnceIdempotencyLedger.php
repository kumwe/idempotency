 * on purpose — a short lease because a token mutation is one quick write, a single combined takeover for
 * failed, expired and lapsed records, a locked ownership re-proof inside the caller's transaction, and a
 * rewrite hook that strips a legacy stored secret on its first replay. Application owns the contract;
