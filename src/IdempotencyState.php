 * `COMPLETED` if a result was captured or `FAILED` if none was. `IdempotencyRecord` hangs its
 * invariants on that split: a result may be carried only alongside `COMPLETED`, only an `IN_PROGRESS`
 * entry may still transition, and only a `COMPLETED` one can answer a replay. The backing strings are
 * the values the API idempotency table keeps in its `state` column, so the enum and a stored row spell
 * the same three stages.
 *
 * `BusinessRecord\Domain\BusinessRecordIdempotencyState` models the same three stages for the
 * business-record command ledger; the two are separate types because the ledgers are separate.
